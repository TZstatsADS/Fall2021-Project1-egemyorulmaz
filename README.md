### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: What Keeps Us Awake at Night?
+ This project is conducted by Egem Yorulmaz

+ Project summary: Over history, what has kept us up at night? This study will explore fear and its affiliated concepts in the history of philosophy. Some questions asked were: What words are most affiliated with "fear" in philosophical writing throughout history? How has the usage of these words changed over time? Do philosophers agree on affiliating certain words with "fear"? What kind of an effect can sociopolitical events have on a philosophical understanding of fear?
